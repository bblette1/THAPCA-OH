# THAPCA-OH

This paper provides a Bayesian re-analysis of data from the THAPCA-OH trial. See our published paper here: [https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/EVIDoa2200196](https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/EVIDoa2200196)

# Replication Instructions

Run file flat-prior-figure.R to reproduce the analyses utilizing non-informative priors. Run files neuro-posterior-density-figure.R and survival-posterior-density-figure.R to reproduce analyses using standardized priors for neurological and survival outcomes, respectively. Run neuro-outcome-benefit-table.R and survival-outcome-benefit-table.R to get corresponding benefit tables. Finally, run ebp-neuro-posterior-density-figure.R to reproduce analyses using evidence-based priors.

The data for this trial can be requested from NHLBI using BioLINCC.
